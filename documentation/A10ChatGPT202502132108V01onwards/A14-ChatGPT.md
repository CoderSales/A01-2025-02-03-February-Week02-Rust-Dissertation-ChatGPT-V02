Incremental Fix: Remove Mutable Static Reference & Maintain Functionality
🔹 Change One Line to Fix LAST_WARNING_TIME Without static mut
🚀 Solution
Replace:

rust
Copy
Edit
static mut LAST_WARNING_TIME: Option<Instant> = None; // Tracks last warning time
With:

rust
Copy
Edit
let mut last_warning_time: Option<Instant> = None;
✅ Explanation:
Fixes the static mut issue by moving last_warning_time into analyze_frequencies(), keeping it local.
Prevents undefined behavior from multiple mutable references to a static variable.
Still limits the warning message to once every 10 seconds.
📌 Next Steps
1️⃣ Compile (cargo build) → Should now work without static mut issues.
2️⃣ Run (cargo run) → Verify warning appears at most once per 10 seconds.

This is the smallest working change to fix the issue while keeping functionality intact. 🚀
