## Out

Summary of Progress
‚úÖ Improvements Achieved
Reduced Stack Overflow Risk

Amplitude Analysis no longer prints excessively and does not cause stack overflow.
Output frequency is controlled (limited to once every 5 seconds).
Detects and Processes Sound Properly

System still detects sound, runs FFT, and processes frequency peaks.
Ensures valid audio input is processed correctly.
No Sound Warning Is Limited

Frequency of ‚ö†Ô∏è No significant sound detected! warning has been reduced.
Prevents overwhelming logs while still giving necessary alerts.
‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Issues / Areas for Refinement
No Sound Warning Appears in Pairs

The warning message still appears twice in a row instead of once.
Likely due to logic that checks silence but does not properly track previous warning states.
No Amplitude Analysis Output Anymore

Although analyze_amplitude() is now called, it does not print results.
This may be due to incorrect handling of the LAST_ANALYSIS_TIME variable or a silent error in logic.
üõ† Next Steps (for future refinement, not immediate)
Fix the No Sound Warning Pairing Issue

Ensure only one warning message is printed per period of silence.
Might need a better state tracking mechanism to prevent duplicate warnings.
Ensure Amplitude Analysis Outputs Data

Double-check if analyze_amplitude() is skipping output due to unintended logic conditions.
Possibly add debugging prints to verify it runs as expected.
üìå Status
Stable Execution: ‚úÖ No crashes or infinite loops.
Sound Detection Works: ‚úÖ System captures audio, runs FFT.
Log Output Managed: ‚ö†Ô∏è Improved but still some unwanted behavior.
Next Debugging Focus: ‚ö†Ô∏è Fix warning duplication & ensure analyze_amplitude() prints correctly.
Wrap-Up
The core functionality works, and major problems like excessive logging and stack overflow are resolved. Further refinements are needed but can be addressed incrementally. üöÄ

### Next Steps

Add a timer method.

timer method could ensure that after stage 2 of program has run

Only at this point does a summary of analyze_amplitude() print

Only at this point does a summary of percentage of silence during recording print.

Replace print out for no significant sound detected.

What causes program to stop running currently?

### Priority

Next Steps Breakdown
‚úÖ Plan for Timer Method Integration
Introduce a timer method

Ensures that after stage 2 of the program has run, a summary is printed.
Avoids constant intermediate prints, only showing final results.
Modify analyze_amplitude() Summary Output

Instead of printing multiple times, print once at the end of recording.
Replace ‚ÄòNo Significant Sound Detected‚Äô Warning

Instead of multiple logs, summarize percentage of silence after recording.
This will provide a more useful insight instead of repetitive warnings.
Determine What Stops the Program

Current Stop Condition:
The program stops after 30 seconds (std::thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(30))).
This could be modified to stop when recording is complete instead of a fixed time.
üõ† Prioritization for Next Step
‚úÖ Introduce a timer method (Low-risk, small change)
‚úÖ Ensure summary is printed only once (Avoid duplicate logs)
‚úÖ Minimize unnecessary warnings (Only show meaningful data)
‚ö†Ô∏è Program stop logic may be adjusted later (Not a priority yet)
Next Immediate Step
üöÄ Implement a simple timer function that:

Runs in a separate thread
Prints amplitude analysis & silence percentage after recording ends
Does not introduce errors or disrupt existing flow
Final Thoughts
This step focuses on small, controlled changes while improving usability. üöÄ
