## Out

Summary of Progress
‚úÖ Improvements Achieved
Reduced Stack Overflow Risk

Amplitude Analysis no longer prints excessively and does not cause stack overflow.
Output frequency is controlled (limited to once every 5 seconds).
Detects and Processes Sound Properly

System still detects sound, runs FFT, and processes frequency peaks.
Ensures valid audio input is processed correctly.
No Sound Warning Is Limited

Frequency of ‚ö†Ô∏è No significant sound detected! warning has been reduced.
Prevents overwhelming logs while still giving necessary alerts.
‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Issues / Areas for Refinement
No Sound Warning Appears in Pairs

The warning message still appears twice in a row instead of once.
Likely due to logic that checks silence but does not properly track previous warning states.
No Amplitude Analysis Output Anymore

Although analyze_amplitude() is now called, it does not print results.
This may be due to incorrect handling of the LAST_ANALYSIS_TIME variable or a silent error in logic.
üõ† Next Steps (for future refinement, not immediate)
Fix the No Sound Warning Pairing Issue

Ensure only one warning message is printed per period of silence.
Might need a better state tracking mechanism to prevent duplicate warnings.
Ensure Amplitude Analysis Outputs Data

Double-check if analyze_amplitude() is skipping output due to unintended logic conditions.
Possibly add debugging prints to verify it runs as expected.
üìå Status
Stable Execution: ‚úÖ No crashes or infinite loops.
Sound Detection Works: ‚úÖ System captures audio, runs FFT.
Log Output Managed: ‚ö†Ô∏è Improved but still some unwanted behavior.
Next Debugging Focus: ‚ö†Ô∏è Fix warning duplication & ensure analyze_amplitude() prints correctly.
Wrap-Up
The core functionality works, and major problems like excessive logging and stack overflow are resolved. Further refinements are needed but can be addressed incrementally. üöÄ
