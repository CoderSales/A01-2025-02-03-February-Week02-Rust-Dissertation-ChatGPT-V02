📌 Next Steps: Enhancing Accuracy & Musicality
We'll focus on three key areas to refine the system:

1️⃣ Improve Frequency Accuracy
🔹 Goal: Reduce over-quantization & improve precision.
🔧 Steps:

Verify FFT settings (window size, sample rate)
Check if frequency rounding is affecting output.
Apply Hann or Hamming windowing to improve spectral clarity.
2️⃣ Enhance Note Recognition
🔹 Goal: Reduce "Unknown" classifications & improve reliability.
🔧 Steps:

Expand frequency-to-note mapping with more precision.
Add a tolerance range (±1 Hz) to smooth out minor variations.
Print MIDI note number alongside note name for verification.
3️⃣ Enable Chord Recognition
🔹 Goal: Detect multiple simultaneous notes.
🔧 Steps:

Modify FFT peak analysis to capture top 2-3 dominant frequencies.
Print multiple detected notes instead of just one.
Implement a chord dictionary to recognize basic triads (Cmaj, Dmin, etc.).
