📌 Next Steps Summary
✅ Current Status:

cargo run works without errors.
Device selection works for microphone or virtual cable.
Noise profile captures successfully.
Fundamental frequencies detected.
cargo test and cargo build pass without issues.
🔹 Potential Improvements for Later
1️⃣ Improve Frequency Accuracy:

Check if FFT settings (windowing, sample rate) are causing over-quantization.
Verify floating-point precision in frequency calculation.
2️⃣ Enhance Note Detection:

Expand note mapping to avoid "Unknown" results.
Implement tolerance threshold to prevent slight variations from misclassification.
3️⃣ Enable Chord Recognition:

Modify FFT peak analysis to detect two or more simultaneous notes.
4️⃣ Improve Noise Handling:

Adjust noise subtraction to avoid over-smoothing.
Implement adaptive noise filtering for better real-world performance.
🚀 Final Takeaway:
System is functional but can be refined for better accuracy & responsiveness.
🔜 Future enhancements can focus on real-time visualization & improved musicality detection.

📌 Pause here for now—great work! Let me know when you're ready to continue. 🎵🔥
