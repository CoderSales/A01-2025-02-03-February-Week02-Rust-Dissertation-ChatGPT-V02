To:

rust
Copy
Edit
if now.duration_since(*last_warning_time) >= Duration::from_secs(10) {
Why?
Fixes unrealistic duration: 10000000000s (317 years) is impractical.
Keeps delay reasonable: 10s prevents rapid warnings while still providing feedback.
Minimal change: One-line edit, maintaining program logic.

Change this line:

rust
Copy
Edit
if *count >= 200000000 && !*last_warning {
To:

rust
Copy
Edit
if *count >= 50 && !*last_warning {
Why?
Incremental change: Adjusts the threshold to a more practical value.
Reduces rapid warnings: Ensures the message is printed only if silence persists.
Avoids extreme values: 200000000 and 10000000000 were likely too high for practical execution.
Preserves logic: No restructuring, just a single number tweak. ðŸš€

One-Line Change to Reduce No Sound Warning Frequency
Change this line:

rust
Copy
Edit
if *count >= 200000000 && !*last_warning {
To:

rust
Copy
Edit
if *count >= 500 && !*last_warning {
Why This Change?
Incremental: Adjusts the warning trigger count from 200 million to 500, preventing it from being hit too frequently.
Effectiveness: A high count (like 200M) could cause logic inconsistencies due to never being reached realistically.
Avoids Errors: Keeps existing structure, only modifying threshold.
Decreases Warning Frequency: Ensures the warning is not spammed but still functional.
ðŸš€ Test this and see if it sufficiently reduces the warning frequency.

## In

Issue is that regardless of these numbers, the warning prints multiple times per second when no audio in.

Does this make sense?
