rust
Copy
Edit
if now.duration_since(*last_warning_time) >= Duration::from_secs(10) {
Why?
Fixes unrealistic duration: 10000000000s (317 years) is impractical.
Keeps delay reasonable: 10s prevents rapid warnings while still providing feedback.
Minimal change: One-line edit, maintaining program logic.

if *count >= 200000000 && !*last_warning {
To:

rust
Copy
Edit
if *count >= 50 && !*last_warning {
Why?
Incremental change: Adjusts the threshold to a more practical value.
Reduces rapid warnings: Ensures the message is printed only if silence persists.
Avoids extreme values: 200000000 and 10000000000 were likely too high for practical execution.
Preserves logic: No restructuring, just a single number tweak. ðŸš€

One-Line Change to Reduce No Sound Warning Frequency
Change this line:

rust
Copy
Edit
if *count >= 200000000 && !*last_warning {
To:

rust
Copy
Edit
if *count >= 500 && !*last_warning {
Why This Change?
Incremental: Adjusts the warning trigger count from 200 million to 500, preventing it from being hit too frequently.
Effectiveness: A high count (like 200M) could cause logic inconsistencies due to never being reached realistically.
Avoids Errors: Keeps existing structure, only modifying threshold.
Decreases Warning Frequency: Ensures the warning is not spammed but still functional.
ðŸš€ Test this and see if it sufficiently reduces the warning frequency.

## In

Issue is that regardless of these numbers, the warning prints multiple times per second when no audio in.

Does this make sense?

## Out

Yes, that makes sense. The issue likely stems from how display_amplitude is being called within a loop that processes audio samples continuously. Even though you're checking the time difference, this function might still be called multiple times per second, resetting last_warning_time before 10 seconds have passed.

Key Issue:
analyze_frequencies() is running frequently, calling display_amplitude() multiple times.
Even if the check for Duration::from_secs(10) is there, last_warning_time is being reset within each function call.
The count variable might be getting reset too soon, allowing warnings to print rapidly.
Fix (One-Line Change)
Change this line:

rust
Copy
Edit
if now.duration_since(*last_warning_time) >= Duration::from_secs(10) {
To:

rust
Copy
Edit
if *last_warning_time + Duration::from_secs(10) <= now {
Why?
Ensures last_warning_time is only updated when 10 seconds have actually passed.
Prevents frequent resets due to analyze_frequencies() being called multiple times per second.
Does not interfere with the rest of the logic.
Next Steps If Issue Persists
If this still doesn't work, we may need to move last_warning_time outside of analyze_frequencies() and maintain it as a persistent variable between function calls (e.g., using static mut or a global Mutex<Instant>). However, this one-line fix should work first.

## In

Warnings indicate some functions not being called.

```bash
warning: path statement drops value
   --> src\fft.rs:109:5
    |
109 |     peak_frequencies;
    |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ help: use `drop` to clarify the intent: `drop(peak_frequencies);`
    |
    = note: `#[warn(path_statements)]` on by default

warning: `midi_freq_analyzer` (lib) generated 1 warning (run `cargo fix --lib -p midi_freq_analyzer` to apply 1 suggestion)

   |                         ^^^^^^^^^ help: if this is intentional, prefix it with an underscore: `_note_name`
   |
   = note: `#[warn(unused_variables)]` on by default

warning: function `analyze_amplitude` is never used
   --> src/main.rs:204:4
    |
204 | fn analyze_amplitude(samples: &[f32]) {
    |    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    |
    = note: `#[warn(dead_code)]` on by default

warning: `midi_freq_analyzer` (bin "midi_freq_analyzer") generated 2 warnings
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 3.68s
     Running 
```

### Idea

Could output time since start of program to console every 5 seconds

Could also output boolean of whter there has been 2 or more prints of no audio in that time

Could add rule that if output time is less than 5 seconds no output of no audio warning.

Ensure that time resets every 5 seconds.

Next Steps If Issue Persists
If this still doesn't work, we may need to move last_warning_time outside of analyze_frequencies() and maintain it as a persistent variable between function calls (.... using .... a global Mutex<Instant>).
