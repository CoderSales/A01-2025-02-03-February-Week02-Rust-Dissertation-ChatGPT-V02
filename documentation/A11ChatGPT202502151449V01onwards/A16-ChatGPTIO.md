✅ Final Fix: Align wgpu with the Exact Latest Version
Your system requires wgpu = "24.0.1", so we must match it exactly.

🔧 Update Cargo.toml

Edit
[package]
name = "midi_freq_analyzer"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
cpal = "0.15"
rustfft = "6.1.0"
fundsp = "0.14"
eframe = "0.31.0"   # Ensure compatibility
wgpu = "24.0.1"     # Set exact version
winapi = { version = "0.3", features = ["winuser", "windef"] }
wasm-bindgen = "0.2.97"  # Ensure compatibility
🛠 Steps to Apply Fix
1️⃣ Clean previous builds

bash

cargo clean
2️⃣ Update dependencies

cargo update
3️⃣ Build the project

bash

cargo build
🔍 Why This Works
wgpu = "24.0.1" → Matches available crate version.
eframe = "0.31.0" → Matches latest stable.
wasm-bindgen = "0.2.97" → Resolves conflicts.
winapi features → Fixes Windows-specific issues.
🚀 Try this and let me know if the build succeeds!
