Observations
CLI output appears stable:

No flickering or overlapping of previous lines.
Live amplitude bar [______] updates correctly.
Amplitude analysis aligns with expected behavior.
Improvements Applied:

âœ… Ensured overwrite of previous amplitude bars.
âœ… Smoothed updates with 10ms delay to avoid excessive flickering.
âœ… No apparent performance bottlenecks.
Next Steps
Since the current implementation works as expected, let's move forward with:

Thread Summary (~10s after start) â†’ Print active threads.
bitrate.rs (Audio settings summary) â†’ Print sample format, channels, and sample rate.
Would you like me to draft bitrate.rs now? ðŸš€
