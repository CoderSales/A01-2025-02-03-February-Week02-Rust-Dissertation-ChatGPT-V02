## Notes

### From rust-lang documentation:

#### Structs used in audio.rs

- [std::fs > Struct File](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fs/struct.File.html) is "an object providing access to an open file on the filesystem."

- From [std::io > Struct BufReader](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/struct.BufReader.html), "The BufReader<R> struct adds buffering to any reader."

This is because "It can be excessively inefficient to work directly with a Read instance. For example, every call to read on TcpStream results in a system call. A BufReader<R> performs large, infrequent reads on the underlying Read and maintains an in-memory buffer of the results."

### Rodio

[Crate rodio](https://docs.rs/rodio/latest/rodio/) is an "Audio playback library."

"The main concept of this library is the Source trait, which represents a sound (streaming or not). In order to play a sound, there are three steps:

- Create an **object** that represents the **streaming sound**. It can be a sine wave, a buffer, a decoder, etc. or even your own type that implements the Source trait.

- **Get** an **output stream handle** **to** a **physical device**. For example, get a **stream** **to** the **system’s default sound device** with **OutputStream::try_default()**

- Call **.play_raw(source)** **on** the **output stream handle**.

The play_raw function expects the source to produce f32s, which may not be the case. If you get a compilation error, try calling .convert_samples() on the source to fix it.

For example, here is how you would play an audio file:"

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::BufReader;
use rodio::{Decoder, OutputStream, source::Source};

// Get an output stream handle to the default physical sound device.
// Note that no sound will be played if _stream is dropped
let (_stream, stream_handle) = OutputStream::try_default().unwrap();
// Load a sound from a file, using a path relative to Cargo.toml
let file = BufReader::new(File::open("examples/music.ogg").unwrap());
// Decode that sound file into a source
let source = Decoder::new(file).unwrap();
// Play the sound directly on the device
stream_handle.play_raw(source.convert_samples());

// The sound plays in a separate audio thread,
// so we need to keep the main thread alive while it's playing.
std::thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_secs(5));
```

### Next step ideas from Rust documentation (Very Similar to the above but unformatted.)

The following section, between horizontal rules, is taken from [Crate rodio > Source](https://docs.rs/rodio/latest/rodio/)

Crate rodio

Source

Audio playback library.

The main concept of this library is the Source trait, which represents a sound (streaming or not). In order to play a sound, there are three steps:

Create an object that represents the streaming sound. It can be a sine wave, a buffer, a decoder, etc. or even your own type that implements the Source trait.
Get an output stream handle to a physical device. For example, get a stream to the system’s default sound device with OutputStream::try_default()
Call .play_raw(source) on the output stream handle.
The play_raw function expects the source to produce f32s, which may not be the case. If you get a compilation error, try calling .convert_samples() on the source to fix it.

For example, here is how you would play an audio file:

use std::fs::File;
use std::io::BufReader;
use rodio::{Decoder, OutputStream, source::Source};

// Get an output stream handle to the default physical sound device.
// Note that no sound will be played if _stream is dropped
let (_stream, stream_handle) = OutputStream::try_default().unwrap();
// Load a sound from a file, using a path relative to Cargo.toml
let file = BufReader::new(File::open("examples/music.ogg").unwrap());
// Decode that sound file into a source
let source = Decoder::new(file).unwrap();
// Play the sound directly on the device
stream_handle.play_raw(source.convert_samples());

// The sound plays in a separate audio thread,
// so we need to keep the main thread alive while it's playing.
std::thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_secs(5));
Sink
In order to make it easier to control the playback, the rodio library also provides a type named Sink which represents an audio track.

Instead of playing the sound with play_raw, you can add it to a Sink instead.

Get a Sink to the output stream, and .append() your sound to it.
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::BufReader;
use std::time::Duration;
use rodio::{Decoder, OutputStream, Sink};
use rodio::source::{SineWave, Source};

// _stream must live as long as the sink
let (_stream, stream_handle) = OutputStream::try_default().unwrap();
let sink = Sink::try_new(&stream_handle).unwrap();

// Add a dummy source of the sake of the example.
let source = SineWave::new(440.0).take_duration(Duration::from_secs_f32(0.25)).amplify(0.20);
sink.append(source);

// The sound plays in a separate thread. This call will block the current thread until the sink
// has finished playing all its queued sounds.
sink.sleep_until_end();
The append method will add the sound at the end of the sink. It will be played when all the previous sounds have been played. If you want multiple sounds to play simultaneously, you should create multiple Sinks.

The Sink type also provides utilities such as playing/pausing or controlling the volume.

Please note that the Sink requires the OutputStream, make sure that the OutputStream is not dropped before the sink.

### Result of cargo run

The UI looks reasonably good.

There are four buttons

1. Listen

2. Stop Listening

(Both of these work well.)

3. Toggle Live/File

4. Analyze

About every second it outputs Analyzing audio... to the terminal while running

### Issues from running the file

No playback heard.

#### Proposed solution

As soon as a sound is recorded, it gets played back once stop listening is pressed

- This should be both audio

- and visual of the wave.

### Analysis issue

Analysis does not seem to output any results.
