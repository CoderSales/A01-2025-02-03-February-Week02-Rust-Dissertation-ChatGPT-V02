# Chat

## Input

This Chat request is a stretch objective.

### Notes on

#### Visual Scaling Aspect ratio

0.09 y axis height

to

130 x axis width

#### Audio to Video Playback ratio of speed

visual finishes slightly ahead of audio, but almost perfect.

### Suggestion

Possibly if video could playback at about 11 / 12ths of current speed
this might sync up audio and video closer.

### Next features

#### Frequency analysis

Could it be possible to listen for frequencies and output them?

i.e.

#### Recording

Record live audio in and play back output video close to live

#### Instrument Chord detection

If playing a guitar or piano chord

the software would:

- detect the main frequencies

- estimate the chord being played e.g. C Major

#### package code

Package parts of code into separate files

#### Frequency display

Show frequencies on a scale from 5 Hz to 20 kHz

#### Take input from user

Create GUI input slider for volume

#### Sync processing suggestion

Is it possible to process 2 secconds of audio at a time?

So that the visuals and audio sync up?

## Output

Stretch Objectives & Implementation Feasibility
1Ô∏è‚É£ Visual Scaling - Aspect Ratio Improvement
Current:

Y-axis height: 0.09
X-axis width: 130
Fix Proposal:

Increase x-axis scale further for a wider waveform.
Reduce y-axis range slightly to avoid clipping.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Audio-to-Video Playback Sync
Current:

Video finishes slightly ahead of audio.
Fix Proposal:

Reduce FPS by ~11/12ths
Formula: New_FPS = Current_FPS * (11/12)
Implementation: Adjust FPS = 440 instead of 480.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Frequency Analysis
‚úî Feasible using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
‚úî Extract dominant frequencies from FFT data.

Implementation Plan:

Find the peak frequency per frame.
Output the strongest frequency every frame.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Live Recording & Real-Time Playback
‚úî Feasible using cpal crate for real-time audio input.
‚úî Play processed video simultaneously with input sound.

Implementation Plan:

Capture microphone input.
Process it with FFT & visualization.
Ensure <50ms latency.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Instrument Chord Detection
‚úî Feasible using Harmonic Product Spectrum (HPS).
‚úî Detect multiple fundamental frequencies in real-time.

Implementation Plan:

Map detected frequencies to musical notes.
Compare notes to known chord structures.
Output estimated chord (e.g., C Major, D minor).
6Ô∏è‚É£ Package Code into Modules
‚úî Feasible - Refactor into multiple files.

Implementation Plan:

audio.rs ‚Üí Audio handling & FFT
visualization.rs ‚Üí GUI & waveform plotting
main.rs ‚Üí Entry point
7Ô∏è‚É£ Frequency Display (5 Hz - 20 kHz)
‚úî Feasible with logarithmic frequency scaling.
‚úî egui::plot::LogScale can display correct spectrum.

Implementation Plan:

X-axis ‚Üí Logarithmic frequency scale
Y-axis ‚Üí Amplitude representation
8Ô∏è‚É£ User Input - GUI Slider for Volume Control
‚úî Feasible with egui::Slider.

Implementation Plan:

Add Volume (%) slider in GUI.
Modify playback volume dynamically.
9Ô∏è‚É£ Sync Processing Suggestion - 2s Batching
‚úî Feasible by buffering audio in 2-second chunks.

Implementation Plan:

Process every 2s of data at once.
Plot 2s worth of waveform before moving forward.
Ensure FPS remains adaptive.
üìå Next Steps
Reduce FPS to 440 (~11/12th speed).
Add frequency detection for real-time analysis.
Implement log-scale frequency visualization (5Hz - 20kHz).
Refactor into modules (audio.rs, visual.rs).
Add GUI slider for real-time volume control.
Prototype 2-second batch processing for synchronization.
üöÄ Stretch Goal
üéØ Live chord detection for instruments (Guitar/Piano).
üéØ Implement HPS for note identification.
üéØ Output detected chord in GUI.
