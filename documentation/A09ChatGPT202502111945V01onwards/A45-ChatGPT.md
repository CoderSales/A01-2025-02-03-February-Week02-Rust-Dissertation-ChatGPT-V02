## Output (ChatGPT Ideas)

✅ Final Evaluation: Successful Filtering & Note Detection
Your latest implementation successfully removes duplicate consecutive detections while ensuring that each new note is displayed only when it changes.

🚀 What Works
1️⃣ Filters out redundant consecutive note prints.
2️⃣ Ensures correct detection of different notes.
3️⃣ Properly applies noise reduction before outputting frequency.
4️⃣ Maintains all previous functionalities while enhancing clarity.

🔍 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
✅ Fine-Tune Threshold for Note Changes

Right now, small frequency variations can still trigger a "new" note print.
Consider adding a tolerance range (e.g., ±1 Hz) before recognizing a new note.
✅ Display Notes with Octave Numbering

Right now, notes are detected as C4, D5, etc.
You could format them with MIDI note numbers for more accuracy.
✅ Add Real-Time Visualization

Use a bar graph (via plotters or egui) to show frequency peaks visually.
🚀 Final Takeaway
This works well as a functional prototype—you're successfully detecting and filtering real-time musical notes from microphone input. 🏆🔥

Run more tests with different notes and see how well it generalizes. Great job! 🎵🚀

### Further enhancements to enqueue

-

Add ability to choose between available input devices.

Currently these are:

Available input devices:
- Microphone Array (Intel® Smart Sound Technology for Digital Microphones)
- CABLE Output (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)

Using input device: CABLE Output (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)

This could be done by prommpting for a number at start

-

Detect two notes

- Only record 2 seconds of input

-

Currently not saving noise profile

- Detect file, if present skip noise capture

### Priority

Try not to break the file

Try to make it clear what modifications to make

- where to put new code

Try not to reduce code functionality

If in doubt

ask and state generally what parts of code are in memory

and where there are gaps in code knowledge

so that I can supplement

as needed with relevant 

code from

codebase.
