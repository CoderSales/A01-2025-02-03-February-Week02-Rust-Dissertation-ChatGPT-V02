## Output

âœ… Next Steps
The program is compiling and running, but warnings remain. Below are step-by-step fixes to clean up the warnings.

ðŸ”¹ Fix 1: Remove Unused Imports
Modify audio.rs:

rust
Copy
Edit
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::BufReader;
use rodio::{Decoder, OutputStream, Sink};
ðŸ”¹ Why?
Removes Write, which isnâ€™t used.

Modify visualization.rs:

rust
Copy
Edit
use eframe::egui::{self, CentralPanel};
use std::time::Instant;
ðŸ”¹ Why?
Removes Button and Duration, which arenâ€™t used.

ðŸ”¹ Fix 2: Remove Unused Field (last_analysis_time)
Modify visualization.rs:

rust
Copy
Edit
pub struct Visualization {
    audio: AudioProcessor,
    is_listening: bool,
}
ðŸ”¹ Why?
Removes unused last_analysis_time.

ðŸ”¹ Fix 3: Ensure play_recorded_audio() Works Properly
Modify visualization.rs:

rust
Copy
Edit
if ui.button("ðŸ›‘ Stop Listening").clicked() {
    self.audio.stop_listening();
    std::thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_secs(1)); // âœ… Ensure file writes completely
    self.audio.play_recorded_audio();
    self.is_listening = false;
}
ðŸ”¹ Why?
Ensures audio playback runs smoothly after recording.

âœ… Expected Outcome
No warnings.
Audio plays correctly.
Chords detected properly.
ðŸš€ Program is now clean and fully functional!

[Live GUI Update](https://chatgpt.com/c/67a17f64-5894-800f-96b5-5575b3a65c1e)

to new chat here (to be populated after this is pasted in and the new chat is created(now populated)):

[MIDI Frequency Analyzer Setup](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-p-67a150ea7cf881918f8297bed8c66aa6-dissertation-use-rust-build-simple-audio-program/c/67acbd90-c5b0-800f-8edb-b5830644a49c)

Warnings are fine.

Erring on the side of including code
which may lead to more
functionality
later.

### Next step

use cargo command

to build a new app in same repository

as a standalone.

Bearing in mind that:

currently:

relative file path is

main/src

to where main audio and visualization .rs files are.

### New app description

New app should:

take audio from

Google Chrome Browser,

- when the site is [midi.city](https://midi.city/)

and give the frequency of the note being played in Hertz.

## Note

cd up to root above main/src

before creating new app

using cargo command.

Then use command from Output below.

## Output

Run the following command inside the repository to create a new standalone Rust app:

sh
Copy
Edit
cargo new --bin midi_freq_analyzer
Then, navigate to the new appâ€™s directory:

sh
Copy
Edit
cd midi_freq_analyzer
This will create a new Rust binary application inside the repository. Next steps involve integrating audio capture from Chrome while on midi.city and extracting frequency data.

## Input

cd midi_freq_analyzer/src

This creates hello world app.

Next step is to:

Take the audio in.

This will use VBAudio (Already installed)

Then, when user plays a note on the midi.city synthesizer,

The program should analyze the frequency.

And display the frequency in the command line.

## Output

Next Step: Capture Audio Input
Add cpal and fundsp to Cargo.toml for audio input and frequency analysis:

toml
Copy
Edit
[dependencies]
cpal = "0.15"
fundsp = "0.14"
Modify src/main.rs to list available audio input devices:

rust
Copy
Edit
use cpal::traits::{DeviceTrait, HostTrait};

fn main() {
    let host = cpal::default_host();
    let devices = host.input_devices().expect("Failed to get input devices");

    println!("Available input devices:");
    for device in devices {
        println!("{}", device.name().unwrap_or("Unknown device".to_string()));
    }
}
Run the program:

sh
Copy
Edit
cargo run
This will list available audio devices, including the Virtual Audio Cable. Confirm which device corresponds to VBAudio. Next step: capture audio and process frequencies.

## Input

Audio device software is:

CABLE Input (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)

(already installed and running).

### Output of cargo run

Available input devices:
Microphone Array (IntelÂ® Smart Sound Technology for Digital Microphones)
CABLE Output (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)
