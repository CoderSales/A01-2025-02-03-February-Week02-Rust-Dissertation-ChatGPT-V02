## Prompt

error[E0432]: unresolved import winapi::um::winuser

## Response

The error E0432: unresolved import winapi::um::winuser means that Rust cannot find the winuser module inside the winapi crate. Hereâ€™s how you can resolve it:

1. Ensure the winapi crate is added
Check your Cargo.toml and make sure the winapi crate is included with the correct features:

toml
Copy
Edit
[dependencies]
winapi = { version = "0.3", features = ["winuser"] }
2. Run cargo clean and cargo build
If you recently added the feature, clean and rebuild:

sh
Copy
Edit
cargo clean
cargo build
3. Verify Import Path
The correct import path should be:

rust
Copy
Edit
use winapi::um::winuser::*;
If your Cargo.toml setup is correct, and it still doesnâ€™t work, try explicitly specifying the winapi version:

sh
Copy
Edit
cargo update
Let me know if you need more debugging! ðŸš€
